|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Data Privacy            | Encrypt sensitive data and minimize retention.    |
| Auditability            | Maintain detailed logs of AI decision processes.  |
| Explainability          | Ensure AI outputs are interpretable and documented.|
| Access Control          | Implement role-based access management (RBAC).    |

### **2.2 Organizational Policies**
ðŸ“Œ **Internal Standards:**
- **Data Usage Policies**: Define how data is collected, stored, and processed.
- **AI Model Governance**: Establish rules for deploying, updating, and retiring AI models.
- **Incident Reporting**: Create protocols for reporting non-compliance.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Practices:**
- Conduct regular **compliance training** for teams.
- Assign a **Compliance Officer** to oversee adherence to standards.
- Develop an **AI Ethics Charter** for organizational alignment.
