## **2. Incident Response Framework**

### **2.1 Incident Lifecycle**
ðŸ“Œ **Key Stages of Incident Management:**
1. **Detection**: AI systems detect anomalies or failures in real-time.
2. **Investigation**: Incident details are analyzed to identify the root cause.
3. **Mitigation**: Temporary fixes are applied to limit impact.
4. **Resolution**: Permanent solutions are implemented.
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Lessons learned are documented to improve processes.

ðŸ”¹ **AI Incident Management Tools:**

|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AI Incident Detector  | Monitors and flags anomalies in real time.        |
| Root Cause Analyzer   | Identifies the origin of incidents automatically. |
| Incident Workflow AI  | Manages incident ticketing and resolution steps.  |

### **2.2 Roles & Responsibilities**
| **Role**            | **Responsibility**                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Manager    | Oversees the incident resolution process.            |

## **3. Disaster Recovery Strategy**

### **3.1 Recovery Objectives**
ðŸ“Œ **Core Metrics:**
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum time allowed to restore functionality.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum data loss measured in time (e.g., last backup).

ðŸ”¹ **AI-SDLC RTO and RPO Goals:**
| **Metric** | **Target** |
|------------|------------|
| RTO        | < 1 hour   |
| RPO        | < 15 minutes |

### **3.2 Backup & Restore Procedures**
ðŸ“Œ **Best Practices:**
- **Automated Backups**: Schedule regular snapshots of critical systems.
- **AI-Powered Restore**: Automate data restoration with AI to reduce downtime.
- **Testing Recovery Plans**: Conduct disaster recovery simulations quarterly.

ðŸ”¹ **Backup & Restore Tools:**
| **Tool**               | **Function**                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AWS Backup            | Automates data backup and restoration workflows.  |
| AI Snapshot Manager   | Manages incremental backups for faster recovery.  |
| Disaster Recovery AI  | Simulates recovery scenarios for training.        |

### **3.3 Infrastructure Resilience**
ðŸ“Œ **Resiliency Techniques:**
- Use **multi-region deployments** to prevent downtime during localized failures.
- Enable **auto-scaling for fault tolerance** during high traffic or failures.
- Implement **redundant systems** for critical AI workloads.

ðŸ”¹ **Resilience Tools:**
| **Tool**                | **Function**                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Kubernetes Auto-Healing | Restarts failed pods automatically.              |
| Load Balancer AI        | Redistributes workloads during system failure.   |
| AI Fault Detector       | Identifies infrastructure weak points.           |

## **4. Automated AI-Powered Response Mechanisms**

### **4.1 AI Incident Detection & Alerting**
ðŸ“Œ **Automated Steps:**
1. AI detects anomalies in system performance metrics.
2. AI triggers alerts via incident management platforms (e.g., PagerDuty, OpsGenie).
3. AI provides a root cause analysis and suggests mitigation strategies.

### **4.2 Automated Rollbacks & Failover**
ðŸ“Œ **Steps for Automated Failover:**
- **Rollback Deployments**: Revert to the last stable release when errors are detected.
- **Failover Activation**: Switch to backup systems during major outages.
- **Traffic Redistribution**: Reroute user traffic to operational systems.

ðŸ”¹ **Automated Tools for Rollbacks & Failover:**
| **Tool**                | **Function**                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| AI Rollback Engine      | Detects faulty deployments and initiates rollbacks. |
| Failover Orchestrator   | Automates failover to backup infrastructure.      |
| AI Load Redistributor   | Dynamically adjusts traffic flows during incidents. |
