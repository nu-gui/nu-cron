# **Post-Deployment Evaluation Guide for AI-SDLC**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
This document provides guidelines for evaluating the success of deployments within the AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (AI-SDLC). Post-deployment evaluation ensures that deployed features meet quality, performance, and user satisfaction standards while identifying areas for improvement.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Evaluation of system performance and reliability after deployment.
- Collection of user feedback and metrics.
- Reporting and tracking of post-deployment issues.

## **2. Objectives of Post-Deployment Evaluation**

### **2.1 Key Goals**
ðŸ“Œ **Performance Validation:**
- Ensure the system meets predefined performance metrics (e.g., response time, uptime).

ðŸ“Œ **Issue Identification:**
- Detect and resolve bugs, errors, and anomalies introduced in production.

ðŸ“Œ **User Feedback Collection:**
- Gather feedback from end-users and stakeholders to assess satisfaction and usability.

ðŸ“Œ **Continuous Improvement:**
- Use insights from evaluation to optimize future deployments and workflows.
