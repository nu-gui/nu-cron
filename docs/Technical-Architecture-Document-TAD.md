## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to define the technical architecture of the AI-SDLC system. It provides an in-depth view of the software components, data flow, AI integrations, system interactions, and deployment architecture to guide developers in implementing the system efficiently.

### **1.2 Scope**
The AI-SDLC system leverages AI to automate various stages of the software development lifecycle, including planning, coding, testing, deployment, and monitoring. This document outlines how different system components interact, including the backend, frontend, databases, AI models, and external integrations.

### **1.3 Assumptions and Constraints**
- The AI models used (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Mistral) have token limitations.
- The system assumes active internet connectivity for AI API interactions.
- Security and compliance constraints must be followed for data handling and encryption.

      - frontend
      - backend
      - postgres
      - redis
  staging:
    type: kubernetes
    namespace: ai-sdlc-staging
    resources:
      cpu: "2"
      memory: "4Gi"
  production:
    type: kubernetes
    namespace: ai-sdlc-prod
    resources:
      cpu: "4"
      memory: "8Gi"
```

#### **ðŸ”¹ Persistent Storage**

## **4. Data Flow & System Interactions**

### **4.1 User Interaction Flow**
1. **Developer requests AI assistance** (e.g., "Refactor this function").
2. AI processes the request and retrieves relevant project context.
3. AI generates suggestions, which the developer **reviews and approves/rejects**.
4. If approved, the AI commits changes to GitHub.
5. AI-powered CI/CD pipelines trigger build, test, and deployment steps.

### **4.2 AI Processing Flow**
1. User input is **sent to the AI Mediator**.
2. AI Mediator **optimizes token usage** and selects the most efficient AI model.
3. AI **generates code, tests, or architecture suggestions**.
4. AI response is stored in **AI memory (vector database)** for retrieval.
5. AI recommendations are **sent back to the user** for action.

---

## **5. Security & Compliance**
### **5.1 Authentication & Authorization**
- OAuth2-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for user roles (Developer, Admin, PM)

### **5.2 Data Encryption**
- All stored AI responses are **encrypted at rest** (AES-256)
- API requests are secured using **TLS 1.3**

### **5.3 AI Model Security & Token Management**
- Secure storage of API keys in **AWS Secrets Manager**
- AI usage monitoring to **prevent excessive token consumption**

## **6. Logging, Monitoring, and Performance Optimization**
### **6.1 System Monitoring**
| **Monitoring Tool** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Prometheus | Tracks API response times, latency |
| ELK Stack | AI-generated logs, debugging errors |
| Grafana | Visual dashboard for AI activity |

### **6.2 Performance Optimization**
- AI **caches frequent responses** to minimize redundant API calls.
- **Vector search (FAISS, Pinecone)** used for **AI memory retrieval**.
- **Auto-scaling for AI inference models** based on real-time demand.

## **7. Future Enhancements**
- **AI-Driven Predictive Debugging** â€“ AI suggests fixes **before errors occur**.
- **AI-Managed Roadmaps** â€“ AI dynamically **prioritizes features based on user feedback**.
- **AI-Guided Cost Optimization** â€“ AI recommends **cloud resource cost reductions**.
