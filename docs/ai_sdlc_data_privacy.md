## **2. Data Privacy Principles**

### **2.1 Core Principles**
ðŸ“Œ **Key Data Privacy Values:**
1. **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for AI operations.
2. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate data usage policies to stakeholders.
3. **Consent**: Obtain explicit user consent for data collection and processing.
4. **Security**: Implement robust mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

ðŸ”¹ **Implementation Guidelines:**
- Limit data retention to the minimum required.
- Ensure all data processing activities are auditable.
- Provide users with tools to access, modify, or delete their data.
