# 🚀 AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (AI-SDLC)

## 📌 Overview  
The **AI-Driven Software Development Lifecycle (AI-SDLC)** is an **autonomous AI-powered software engineering system** designed to **enhance software development efficiency, automate workflows, and optimize project execution using AI**.  

This system **leverages AI for planning, coding, testing, deployment, and monitoring**, allowing for **reduced manual effort, faster iterations, and intelligent decision-making**.  

It integrates **Devin AI, GitHub Copilot, and AISuite multi-model orchestration** to ensure seamless AI-driven development and optimization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
✅ **Automate software development workflows** using AI-driven task execution  
✅ **Enable AI-assisted coding, debugging, and optimization** to improve efficiency  
✅ **Integrate AI-powered CI/CD pipelines** for faster and more reliable deployments  
✅ **Implement AI-powered anomaly detection and self-healing mechanisms**  
✅ **Utilize AI-driven monitoring and analytics** for real-time insights  
✅ **Reduce technical debt** by automating code refactoring and improvements
