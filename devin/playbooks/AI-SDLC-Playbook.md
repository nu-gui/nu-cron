## 📍 **1. AI-SDLC Workflow Phases**  
The **AI-SDLC Playbook** is divided into structured phases, ensuring **AI task execution is optimized and reviewable**.

| **SDLC Phase** | **Purpose** | **AI Execution Time (ACU-Optimized)** |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Planning & Analysis** | AI analyzes requirements, suggests improvements | ⚡ ~5-10 min (1 ACU) |
| **Development & Coding** | AI generates & optimizes feature implementations | ⚡ ~5-15 min (1 ACU) |
| **Testing & Validation** | AI runs unit & integration tests before PR submission | ⚡ ~8-12 min (1 ACU) |
| **Debugging & Refinement** | AI detects issues, applies automated fixes | ⚡ ~5-15 min (1 ACU) |
| **CI/CD & Deployment** | AI manages feature deployment through GitHub Actions | ⚡ ~10 min (1 ACU) |

Each phase follows **structured execution rules, ensuring AI maintains efficiency and task accuracy**.

## 📍 **2. Structured AI-SDLC Execution Workflows**  

### 📌 **Trigger Description: "AI Workflow Execution Rules"**

### ⚙️ **AI Execution Best Practices**  
✅ **Each AI task must be broken into structured steps to ensure ACU efficiency.**  
✅ **AI-generated work must be validated before merging into `main`.**  
✅ **AI automates GitHub PR creation, review, and refinement workflows.**  

#### 🔄 **Automated AI-SDLC Flow**
1️⃣ **AI generates new feature code** → Logs execution updates in `TASKS.md`.  
2️⃣ **AI executes tests & validation** → Ensures code stability before submission.  
3️⃣ **AI submits a GitHub PR** → Developers review AI-generated code.  
4️⃣ **AI applies feedback & refines output** → Improves AI coding consistency.  

✅ **Why?** → Ensures **AI executes structured software development workflows in reviewable, repeatable steps**.

## 📍 **3. Example AI-SDLC Playbook Workflows**  

### 📝 **Phase 1: AI-Powered Feature Development**

📌 **Purpose:** AI automates feature implementation and optimization.

✅ **Steps for Devin AI Execution:**
1️⃣ AI retrieves project requirements & generates new feature code.  
2️⃣ AI ensures generated code adheres to project architecture guidelines.  
3️⃣ AI optimizes code for security, performance, and maintainability.  
4️⃣ AI runs initial AI-powered linting & static analysis checks.  
5️⃣ AI submits code as a GitHub PR for human review.

💡 **AI Execution Time:** ~5-15 min (1 ACU)

---

### 📝 **Phase 2: AI-Driven Testing & Validation**

📌 **Purpose:** AI executes unit, integration, and regression tests before merging code.

✅ **Steps for Devin AI Execution:**
1️⃣ Identify modified files using Git diff →  
```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~1
```
2️⃣ Determine affected test suites and execute relevant tests →  
```bash
pytest tests/modified_files --only-changed && npm test modified_components
```
3️⃣ Analyze test failures and suggest AI-generated fixes.
4️⃣ Flag any failing test cases for human review in GitHub PR comments.

💡 **AI Execution Time:** ~8-12 min (1 ACU)

---

### 📝 **Phase 3: AI-Powered Debugging & Bug Fixing**

📌 **Purpose:** AI identifies and resolves software bugs automatically.

✅ **Steps for Devin AI Execution:**
1️⃣ Retrieve error logs & debugging insights →  
```bash
cat logs/error.log | tail -n 20
```
2️⃣ Analyze root cause and suggest AI-generated fixes.
3️⃣ Apply fixes if tests confirm success; otherwise, flag for manual review.

💡 **AI Execution Time:** ~5-15 min (1 ACU)

---

### 📝 **Phase 4: CI/CD & Deployment Automation**

📌 **Purpose:** AI automates feature deployment through structured GitHub workflows.

✅ **Steps for Devin AI Execution:**
1️⃣ Ensure latest Git branch is up to date →  
```bash
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
```
2️⃣ Run pre-deployment checks (Linting, security scans, tests).
3️⃣ Package & containerize the application using Docker →  
```bash
docker build -t ai-sdlc-app .
```
4️⃣ Deploy the feature to the staging environment.
5️⃣ Run AI-powered post-deployment validation to check system status.

💡 **AI Execution Time:** ~10 min (1 ACU)

## 📍 **4. AI Task Rollback & Iteration Strategy**  

### 📌 **Trigger Description: "AI Rollback & Iteration Rules"**

### 🔄 **Rollback Strategy for AI-SDLC Execution**
✅ **Devin AI must roll back failed executions to maintain software stability.**  
✅ **Rollback must be triggered if AI-generated code does not pass validation.**  
✅ **AI should attempt refinements before requiring human intervention.**  

#### ✅ **Example AI Rollback Execution**
```bash
@Devin rollback to last stable version before the JWT auth changes.
```
📌 **Outcome:** AI undoes changes, applies refinements, and reattempts execution.

✅ **Why?** → Prevents **AI from making costly deployment mistakes**.

---

## 📍 **5. Continuous AI-SDLC Optimization**  
To ensure Devin AI continuously improves software development execution:

✅ **AI-SDLC-Playbook.md must be updated regularly with workflow refinements.**  
✅ **Developers should validate AI-generated SDLC workflows periodically.**  
✅ **AI must track workflow efficiency to refine SDLC automation.**  

---

## 📌 **Next Steps**  
1️⃣ **Devin AI will follow structured SDLC execution using this Playbook.**  
2️⃣ **Developers will validate AI-generated execution workflows.**  
3️⃣ **Future AI-SDLC enhancements will further optimize software development automation.**
