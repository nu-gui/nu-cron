# ⚡ **AI Task Execution Playbook**

## 📌 **Overview**  
This playbook defines **how Devin AI executes tasks**, ensuring **consistent AI workflow execution, ACU efficiency, and structured automation**.

- ✅ **AI task execution is structured into repeatable workflows.**  
- ✅ **ACU usage is optimized by breaking down tasks into ≤1 ACU per request, but up to 4 ACU per session.**  
- ✅ **AI follows rollback strategies for task refinement and iterative learning.**  
- ✅ **After three failed execution attempts, AI must escalate the task for human intervention.**  
- ✅ **AI-generated PRs should be auto-approved if they pass all validation tests to reduce human bottlenecks.**  
- ✅ **Session continuity is maintained via logs in `AI-Task-History.md`.**  

By following these execution rules, Devin AI maintains **high performance and automation reliability**.

## 📍 **1. Structured Playbook Categories**  
To optimize execution, Playbooks are categorized based on **task complexity & ACU usage**.

| **Playbook Title** | **Purpose** | **Estimated ACU Usage** |
|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Setup Development Environment** | Standardizes AI-assisted environment setup | ⚡ ~10 min (1 ACU) |
| **Generate & Optimize Code** | AI-assisted feature implementation | ⚡ ~5-10 min (1 ACU) |
| **Run & Validate Tests** | Ensure AI-generated code passes all tests | ⚡ ~8-12 min (1 ACU) |
| **AI-Managed Debugging & Bug Fixing** | AI-driven debugging and error resolution | ⚡ ~5-15 min (1 ACU) |
| **Deploy AI-Generated Features** | AI-powered CI/CD & deployment execution | ⚡ ~10 min (1 ACU) |

Each Playbook ensures **AI tasks remain small, focused, and efficiently executed**.

## 📍 **2. AI Task Execution Guidelines**  

### 📌 **Trigger Description: "AI Workflow Execution Rules"**

### ⚙️ **AI Execution Best Practices**  
✅ **Limit each AI task to ≤1 ACU per execution request, but allow up to 4 ACU per session.**  
✅ **Devin AI must execute tasks in structured, repeatable workflows.**  
✅ **If an AI task fails three consecutive times, Devin AI must escalate it to a human reviewer.**  
✅ **Human intervention points should be defined in each Playbook.**  
✅ **AI must maintain session tracking logs in `AI-Task-History.md`.**  

#### 🔄 **Automated Execution Flow**
1️⃣ **AI executes a task** → Logs updates in `TASKS.md`.  
2️⃣ **AI performs validation & testing** → Ensures execution accuracy.  
3️⃣ **AI generates GitHub PR comments** → Notifies developers of execution updates.  
4️⃣ **Developers review & refine AI-generated outputs.**

✅ **Why?** → Ensures AI **executes workflows in structured, reviewable steps**.

## 📍 **3. AI Task Refinement & Rollback Strategy**  

### 📝 **Trigger Description: "AI Rollback & Iteration"**

### 🔄 **Rollback Strategy for Task Refinement**
✅ **Devin AI must roll back failed executions automatically.**  
✅ **Rollback must be triggered if AI-generated code does not pass validation.**  
✅ **If an AI-generated PR fails three rounds of review, it must be assigned to a human for final adjustments.**  
✅ **AI should attempt refinements before requiring human intervention.**  
✅ **Execution rollback and refinements must be tracked in `AI-Task-History.md`.**  

#### ✅ **Example AI Rollback Execution**
```bash
@Devin rollback to last stable version before the JWT auth changes.
```
📌 **Outcome:** AI undoes changes, applies refinements, and reattempts execution.

✅ **Why?** → Prevents **Devin AI from making costly execution mistakes**.

---

## 📍 **4. Standardized AI Execution Logging Format**  
To ensure session continuity and improve AI’s ability to track past executions, Devin AI must follow a **structured logging format** in `AI-Task-History.md`.

### 🔹 **AI Log Entry Format:**
```yaml
Task: [Task Name]
Assigned To: Devin AI
Status: ✅ Completed / ⚠️ Failed / ⏳ In Progress
Execution Attempts: [1-3]
Last Known State: [Brief summary of last action before termination]
Timestamp: [Auto-Logged by Devin AI]
```

✅ **Why?** → Ensures AI **accurately retrieves previous task execution details for improved session tracking.**

---

## 📍 **5. AI PR Auto-Approval Strategy**  
To reduce human bottlenecks, AI-generated PRs **should be auto-approved if they pass all predefined tests**.

### 📌 **AI Auto-Approval Rules:**
✅ If a PR **passes 100% of unit, integration, and security tests**, it is **eligible for auto-merging**.  
✅ AI must include **a self-review summary** before marking a PR as auto-approved.  
✅ If **any critical test fails, the PR is flagged for human review.**

💡 **Example AI PR Auto-Approval Message:**
```bash
@team, PR #42 has passed all automated tests (100% coverage).
🚀 Auto-Merging Enabled.
```  
✅ **Why?** → Reduces **manual bottlenecks while maintaining code quality.**

---

## 📍 **6. Continuous AI Execution Optimization**  
To ensure Devin AI continuously improves task execution:

✅ **AI-Task-Execution-Playbook.md must be updated as new best practices emerge.**  
✅ **Developers should validate AI task execution consistency periodically.**  
✅ **AI must track task efficiency to refine execution workflows.**  

---

## 📌 **Next Steps**  
1️⃣ **Devin AI will follow structured task execution using this Playbook.**  
2️⃣ **Developers will validate AI-generated execution logs.**  
3️⃣ **Future AI-SDLC enhancements will further optimize AI workflow automation.**
