# **📜 AI GitHub PR Management Workflow**

---

## **📌 Purpose**  
This document outlines the workflow for **Devin AI’s integration with GitHub** to manage pull requests (PRs), code reviews, and merges. This ensures:  
- Efficient handling of PRs created by Devin AI.  
- Human oversight and validation before merging code.  
- Seamless collaboration between Devin AI and human developers.  
- **Devin AI autonomously suggests the next task based on PR reviews or merge readiness.**  
- **All PR activities and AI-generated decisions are logged in `AI-Task-History.md`.**  

---

## **🔹 Key Responsibilities**  

### **1. Devin AI Responsibilities:**  
- **PR Creation:** Automatically create a PR for AI-generated code.  
- **Code Review Suggestions:** Add comments to highlight potential areas for improvement.  
- **Merge Proposals:** Suggest PRs ready for merging after validation.  
- **Auto-Approval (if applicable):** Auto-merge PRs if all validation tests pass and human approval is not required.  
- **Next Task Suggestion:** Recommend the next development task based on PR status or outstanding project needs.  
- **Task Logging:** Log PR activity and recommendations in `/devin/logs/AI-Task-History.md`.  

### **2. Human Responsibilities:**  
- **PR Validation:** Review PRs created by Devin AI for accuracy and quality.  
- **Merge Decisions:** Approve or reject PRs based on code quality and adherence to standards.  
- **Feedback:** Provide actionable feedback to Devin AI via GitHub comments.  
- **Approve Next Task Suggestion:** Developers confirm the AI-recommended next step before new execution begins.

## **🔹 Workflow Steps**  

### **1️⃣ Task Execution & PR Creation**  
1. Devin AI completes a task (e.g., refactoring a module or implementing a feature).  
2. Devin AI pushes the updated code to a new branch in GitHub with a descriptive branch name:  
   - **Example Branch Name:** `feature/refactor-authentication`  
3. Devin AI creates a PR with the following:  
   - PR Title: Clear and concise task description.  
     - **Example:** `Refactor User Authentication Module`  
   - PR Description: Detailed summary of the changes made, including:  
     - **Purpose:** Why the changes were made.  
     - **Changes:** A summary of the updates (e.g., added functions, fixed bugs).  
     - **Tests:** Details on testing performed and results.  
   - Assigned Reviewer: The human developer responsible for validation.  

---

### **2️⃣ AI Self-Review & Code Analysis**  
1. Devin AI performs an **initial self-review** of the PR:  
   - Adds inline comments to highlight key updates.  
   - Suggests improvements or notes areas requiring human attention.  
2. Example PR Comment by Devin AI:  
   - **Comment on `auth_service.py`, Line 42:**  
     > Consider adding additional error handling for invalid JWT tokens.  

---

### **3️⃣ Human Review & Next Task Suggestion**  
1. Human developers review the PR:  
   - Validate the functionality and logic of the code.  
   - Check for adherence to project standards and coding best practices.  
2. Provide feedback in the form of **GitHub comments** or **change requests**.  
3. If the PR is **ready for merge**, Devin AI suggests the next logical task:  
   ```bash
   @human_developer Next task suggestion: "Implement logging for failed authentication attempts."
   Please approve to create a new session.
   ```
4. **Human Developer Approval:** The developer reviews the suggested task and approves it.
5. **A new Slack session is created to execute the next task.**

✅ **Why?** → Devin AI ensures a structured, AI-driven workflow where new tasks are intelligently suggested based on PR review status.  

---

### **4️⃣ AI Auto-Approval & Merging**  
1. If a PR **passes 100% of unit, integration, and security tests**, it is **eligible for auto-merging**.  
2. AI must include **a self-review summary** before marking a PR as auto-approved.  
3. If any critical test fails, the PR is flagged for human review instead of auto-merging.  

💡 **Example AI PR Auto-Approval Message:**  
```bash
@team, PR #42 has passed all automated tests (100% coverage).
🚀 Auto-Merging Enabled.
```  
✅ **Why?** → Reduces **manual bottlenecks while maintaining code quality.**  

---

### **5️⃣ Post-Merge Task Logging & Notifications**  
1. Once the PR is merged:  
   - Devin AI logs the merge event in **`/devin/logs/AI-Task-History.md`**.  
   - A Slack notification is sent to **`#ai-updates`** confirming the merge.  
   - The next suggested task is presented to the human developer for approval.  

✅ **Example Slack Notification:**  
```
✅ PR Merged: `feature/refactor-authentication`. Documentation Updated.
🎯 Next Task Suggestion: "Implement API rate-limiting."
```

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|  
| **Title**         | Concise task description.                                       | `Refactor User Authentication Module`     |  
| **Description**   | Detailed explanation of changes made, tests performed, and rationale. | `Updated JWT validation logic.`           |  
| **Reviewer**      | Human developer assigned to review the PR.                     | `@john-doe`                               |
