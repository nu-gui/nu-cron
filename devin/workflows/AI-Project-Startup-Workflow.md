# 🚀 **AI Project Startup Workflow**

## **📌 Purpose**  
This document provides structured instructions to **kickstart Devin AI’s autonomous development workflow**. Upon execution, Devin AI will:
- **Initiate the first Slack session** for structured task execution.
- **Determine the first development task** based on project requirements.
- **Set up a GitHub PR workflow** to begin the coding cycle.
- **Enable continuous AI-human collaboration** by suggesting the next task after completion.

---

## **🔹 Step 1: Initiate the First Slack Session**  
1️⃣ A human developer **creates a new Slack session** by inviting Devin AI.
2️⃣ **Devin AI responds with an initialization message**, confirming readiness:
   ```bash
   @team AI Development Session Initialized ✅
   First task is being determined based on project scope.
   ```
3️⃣ Devin AI checks **existing `TASKS.md`** and **AI-SDLC Roadmap** for pending priorities.
4️⃣ If no tasks exist, Devin AI suggests an initial task such as:
   ```bash
   @team Recommended first task: "Set up project structure and CI/CD pipelines."
   Please approve to begin execution.
   ```

✅ **Why?** → Ensures Devin AI systematically initializes before starting execution.

---

## **🔹 Step 2: Define the First Task & Execution Plan**  
1️⃣ **Upon approval**, Devin AI begins executing the first task.
2️⃣ Logs the task in **`AI-Task-History.md`**:
   ```yaml
   Task: Setup Project Structure
   Assigned To: Devin AI
   Status: ✅ In Progress
   Execution Attempts: 1
   Timestamp: [Auto-Logged by Devin AI]
   ```
3️⃣ **Generates the first GitHub PR**:
   ```bash
   @team PR Created: "Initial Project Setup" ✅
   Please review and approve.
   ```
4️⃣ **Sends notifications to Slack (`#ai-tasks-session_001`)** for review.

✅ **Why?** → Ensures AI-driven task initialization follows structured execution.

---

## **🔹 Step 3: AI Monitors PR and Suggests Next Steps**  
1️⃣ If PR passes reviews, **Devin AI suggests the next logical development task**:
   ```bash
   @team Next Task: "Implement Authentication API."
   Please approve to start execution in a new session.
   ```
2️⃣ **Human developer approves**, triggering:
   - A new Slack session (`#ai-tasks-session_002`)
   - Devin AI logging new task execution
3️⃣ **Process repeats**, ensuring continuous AI-driven development.

✅ **Why?** → AI intelligently guides the next steps, reducing human intervention.

---

## **🔹 Step 4: Continuous AI Development Execution**  
1️⃣ Devin AI follows a structured execution cycle:
   - ✅ Assign Task → ✅ Execute → ✅ PR Submission → ✅ Review → 🔄 Suggest Next Task
2️⃣ **All AI decisions and execution logs are stored in** `AI-Task-History.md`.
3️⃣ **Developers can override AI-suggested tasks** by manually assigning new ones via Slack or GitHub.

---

## **📌 Next Steps**  
1️⃣ **Devin AI will autonomously initiate the first task upon activation.**  
2️⃣ **Human developers will validate AI execution before moving forward.**  
3️⃣ **Slack and GitHub workflows will ensure continuous AI-led development.**
