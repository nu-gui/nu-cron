# 🔄 AI Pull Request Management Best Practices

## 📌 Overview
This document defines best practices for managing pull requests in AI-driven development, focusing on conflict resolution, dependencies, and documentation standards.

## 🔍 PR Management Guidelines

### 1. Conflict Resolution Strategy
When resolving conflicts between multiple PRs:
1. Create a new integration PR with properly resolved changes
2. Merge the integration PR first
3. Close the original conflicting PR
4. Document resolution in AI-Task-History.md

### 2. PR Dependencies
#### Documentation PRs
- Can be merged independently if only updating guidelines
- Should be merged before related code PRs
- Must maintain consistent terminology across all docs

#### Code PRs
- Follow dependency order based on functionality
- Environment setup before feature implementation
- Core services before dependent services

### 3. PR Documentation Standards
- Clear summary of changes in PR description
- Link to Devin run that created the PR
- Documentation of any resolved conflicts
- Reference to related PRs and dependencies

## 📊 PR Review Process
1. Verify changes align with project standards
2. Check for conflicts with other PRs
3. Validate documentation updates
4. Ensure proper integration with existing code

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- Review for exposed secrets or credentials
- Validate environment configuration changes
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify security-related documentation updates
