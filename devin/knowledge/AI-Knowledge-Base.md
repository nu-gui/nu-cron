# 📚 **AI-Knowledge-Base: Devin AI’s Structured Knowledge Repository**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
The **AI-Knowledge-Base** serves as Devin AI’s centralized repository for retrieving structured information regarding:

- **Coding standards & best practices** for AI-generated code.  
- **AI task execution workflows & automation rules.**  
- **Project-specific architecture, database, and API guidelines.**  
- **Security, compliance, and AI testing standards.**  
- **Session continuity via structured AI execution logging in `AI-Task-History.md`.**  

This ensures **Devin AI efficiently recalls knowledge** while reducing redundant queries and maintaining execution consistency.

## 📍 **1. Coding Standards & Best Practices**  

### 📝 **Trigger Description: "Coding Guidelines"**  

### 🔍 **Coding Guidelines**  
Devin AI must adhere to the following coding standards:

- **Python** → Follow **PEP 8** standards. All functions must include **docstrings**.  
- **TypeScript** → Adhere to **Airbnb’s TypeScript Style Guide** with strict typing.  
- **Rust** → Follow **Rustfmt styling rules** ensuring memory safety & error handling.  
- **Component Naming** → Use **PascalCase for components**, **camelCase for functions & variables**.  
- **Security Practices** → Never hardcode **API keys, secrets, or credentials**. Use `.env` files.  
- **Testing Requirements** → AI-generated code must **include unit tests before submission**.  

✅ **All AI execution logs related to coding standards must be stored in `AI-Task-History.md`.**

## 📍 **2. AI Workflows & Task Execution Rules**  

### 📝 **Trigger Description: "AI Workflow Execution Rules"**  

### ⚙️ **AI Workflow Execution Guidelines**  
- **Task Execution Flow:**  
  1️⃣ **AI generates code** → 2️⃣ **AI executes tests** → 3️⃣ **AI documents changes** → 4️⃣ **Human developer reviews & approves**.  
- **PR Submission Rules:**  
  - AI-generated PRs must include a **human-readable summary of changes**.  
  - PRs must be **approved by a developer before merging into `main`**.  
- **Rollback Strategy:**  
  - If AI-generated code fails validation, **Devin AI should rollback to the last stable version**.  
  - **Developers can rewind AI memory & retry execution** when needed.  

✅ **All AI execution attempts and rollbacks must be logged in `AI-Task-History.md` to track failures, retries, and resolutions.**

## 📍 **3. Project-Specific Guidelines**  

### 📝 **Trigger Description: "Project Architecture & API Rules"**  

### 📦 **Project Architecture & API Guidelines**  
- **Frontend Framework** → Next.js (TypeScript) must follow **modular component-based design**.  
- **Backend APIs** → All backend services must use **Hono (TypeScript) for edge computing** & **FastAPI (Python) for AI model execution**.  
- **Database & ORM** → Use **Neon PostgreSQL**, managed via **Prisma ORM**.  
- **Authentication** → Implement **Clerk for OAuth2 & JWT authentication flows**.  
- **AI Processing Layer** → AI model requests must be **routed through AISuite for cost-optimized inference selection**.  

✅ **Devin AI must ensure compliance with these architecture rules in every execution cycle.**

## 📍 **4. Security & Compliance**  

### 📝 **Trigger Description: "Security Best Practices"**  

### 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**  
- **Encryption:**  
  - **All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest & in transit**.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Use **OAuth2 & JWT authentication** for secure access control.  
- **AI Security Rules:**  
  - Devin **must never generate code that exposes plaintext passwords**.  
  - All user inputs must be **sanitized to prevent SQL Injection & XSS attacks**.  
- **Logging & Auditing:**  
  - All system logs must be stored securely using **Helicone & ELK Stack** for AI monitoring.  

✅ **All AI security-related tasks must be recorded in `AI-Task-History.md` for compliance tracking.**  

---

## 📍 **5. AI Testing & Validation**  

### 📝 **Trigger Description: "AI Test Automation Rules"**  

### 🧪 **AI Test Automation Rules**  
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - AI must write **unit tests using Jest (TypeScript) & pytest (Python) before PR submission**.  
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - AI must **validate API endpoints & microservices integration before deployment**.  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - AI should **log errors instead of silently failing**.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - AI-generated features must be validated against **TASKS.md requirements** before merging.  

✅ **Devin AI must document all testing results in `AI-Task-History.md`.**  

---

## 📍 **6. AI Knowledge Base Expansion Strategy**  
To maintain **continuous AI improvement**, the Knowledge Base must evolve as follows:

✅ **Update `AI-Knowledge-Base.md` regularly** to reflect project changes.  
✅ **Developers should review & validate AI updates before new knowledge is stored.**  
✅ **New AI best practices must be incorporated into structured guidelines.**  
✅ **Ensure AI logs knowledge retrieval actions in `AI-Task-History.md` for audit tracking.**  

---

## 📌 **Next Steps**  
1️⃣ **Devin AI will utilize this Knowledge Base for structured AI task execution.**  
2️⃣ **Developers must review and refine AI knowledge entries when necessary.**  
3️⃣ **Future AI-SDLC enhancements will further optimize AI knowledge retrieval & accuracy.**
