📌 Expanding Devin AI’s Knowledge Base for Continuous Documentation Maintenance

📌 Purpose:
To ensure Devin AI constantly maintains .md files throughout the development lifecycle, we will add Knowledge Base entries that define:
✅ How AI updates project documentation after every task execution.
✅ How AI assigns & tracks human developer tasks in .md files.
✅ Rules for AI-driven task reporting & historical documentation tracking.

📍 1. Knowledge Base Entry: AI Documentation & Maintenance Rules

📌 Trigger Description: "AI Documentation & Project Maintenance"

# 📝 AI Documentation & Project Maintenance Guidelines  

✅ **Devin AI must maintain and update `.md` files automatically** throughout all phases of development.  
✅ **Devin AI is responsible for logging completed tasks & tracking outstanding assignments.**  
✅ **All AI-generated work must be documented in `TASKS.md` before closing a task.**  
✅ **Human development tasks must be recorded, assigned, and updated upon progress.**  

## 📌 AI Responsibilities:  
1️⃣ **Update `AI-SDLC-Completion-Checklist.md`** after each AI task completion.  
2️⃣ **Modify `TASKS.md` to track AI and human task responsibilities.**  
3️⃣ **Update `AI-SDLC-Performance-Review.md` with AI efficiency metrics.**  
4️⃣ **Ensure all documentation is synchronized in the repository before finalizing a task.**  

## 📌 Human Developer Responsibilities:  
1️⃣ Review AI-generated documentation updates.  
2️⃣ Validate AI task completion before merging PRs.  
3️⃣ Ensure all human tasks are recorded, updated, and closed when completed.  

🚀 **AI and human tasks must be kept in sync to maintain an accurate development lifecycle.**  

📌 Enhancing Devin AI’s Playbooks for AI Documentation Workflows

📌 Purpose:
The AI Documentation Workflow Playbook will instruct Devin AI to:
✅ Automatically update .md files after each task execution.
✅ Track completed & pending tasks for AI and human developers.
✅ Notify human developers via Slack & GitHub comments when documentation is updated.

📍 2. Playbook: AI-Managed Documentation Workflow

📌 Title: "AI-SDLC Documentation Maintenance"
📌 Description: "Ensure .md files remain updated at every stage of development."

✅ Steps for Devin AI Execution:
1️⃣ Identify the last completed AI task.
2️⃣ Update TASKS.md with the task status and next steps.
3️⃣ Modify AI-SDLC-Completion-Checklist.md to log task completion.
4️⃣ Adjust AI-SDLC-Roadmap.md if new features/milestones were introduced.
5️⃣ Track AI performance metrics in AI-SDLC-Performance-Review.md.
6️⃣ If a human task was assigned, notify developers via Slack & GitHub comments.

✅ Example AI-Generated GitHub Comment After Documentation Update:

@team, the latest AI-generated feature "User Authentication Module" has been completed.  
✅ `TASKS.md` has been updated with the completion status.  
✅ `AI-SDLC-Roadmap.md` now includes the next iteration plan.  
✅ `AI-SDLC-Performance-Review.md` reflects AI execution time and PR success rate.  
Please review & confirm task completion before merging. 🚀
