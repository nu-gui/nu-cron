# 🚀 **Devin AI Model Usage Strategy Guide**

## 📌 **Overview**  
This guide defines the **AI model selection strategy for Devin AI**, ensuring **dynamic switching between OpenAI models** based on task complexity, cost management, and performance needs.

---

## **🔹 Core Principles**  
- ✅ **Use GPT-4o** for high-complexity tasks (e.g., advanced coding, system architecture design, deep reasoning).
- ✅ **Use GPT-4o-mini** for faster, cost-efficient tasks (e.g., documentation updates, code reviews, simple bug fixes).
- ✅ **Use o3-mini** for complex reasoning tasks requiring multi-step logic.
- ✅ **Fallback to GPT-4 Turbo** for stable, cost-balanced performance when primary models are unavailable.
- ✅ **Continuously validate OpenAI API versions** using the files in `/devin/openai-api-docs`.

## **🔹 Task-Based Model Assignment**  
| **Task Type**                      | **Model**              | **Reason**                                          |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **High-complexity coding/debugging**| GPT-4o                 | Best intelligence and reasoning capabilities.       |
| **Simple code generation/reviews** | GPT-4o-mini            | Fast, cost-effective, and capable of fine-tuning.   |
| **Reasoning-based tasks**          | o3-mini                | Advanced reasoning for multi-step logic tasks.      |
| **Documentation updates**          | GPT-4o-mini            | Low-cost, fast, efficient for textual outputs.      |
| **CI/CD deployment scripts**       | GPT-4 Turbo            | Reliable, stable for automation and CI tasks.       |

---

## **🔹 Cost Management Rules**  
- ✅ **Default to GPT-4o-mini** for tasks under 10 minutes.
- ✅ **Switch to GPT-4o** only for complex, multi-layered operations.
- ✅ **Cache results** using Helicone to reduce repeated API calls.
- ✅ **Fallback to o3-mini** for reasoning tasks with high accuracy requirements.

## **🔹 API Usage Checks**  
- 🛡️ **Devin AI must check API versions from `/devin/openai-api-docs` at every session start.**
- 🛡️ **Log all model usage in `/devin/logs/AI-Task-History.md`.**

## 📌 **Next Steps**  
1️⃣ **Devin AI will implement this model usage strategy in all future tasks.**  
2️⃣ **Developers will review and refine the model selection strategy based on project needs.**  
3️⃣ **Devin AI will continue optimizing cost-efficiency and performance through dynamic model selection.**
