# üß† AI Task Learning Model

## üìå Overview
This document defines how Devin AI learns from task execution history to suggest appropriate next tasks that align with the project's SDLC.

## üîÑ Task Suggestion Framework

### 1. SDLC Phase Mapping
Each task must be mapped to one of the following SDLC phases:
1. Planning & Requirement Analysis
2. System Design & Architecture
3. AI-Assisted Development
4. AI-Driven Testing
5. AI-Optimized Deployment
6. AI-Assisted Monitoring
7. AI-Infused Evolution

### 2. Task Relationship Tracking
- Use vector embeddings to track task relationships
- Store task context and outcomes
- Track dependencies between tasks
- Monitor task success metrics

### 3. Next Task Selection Rules
1. Within-Phase Progression:
   - Complete all required tasks within current phase
   - Follow phase-specific task patterns
   - Ensure prerequisites are met

2. Phase Transitions:
   - Verify phase completion criteria
   - Check for blocking issues
   - Validate readiness for next phase

3. Task Priority Factors:
   - Critical path dependencies
   - Developer feedback
   - Historical success rates
   - Resource availability

### 4. Learning from Feedback
1. Sources of Feedback:
   - Developer PR reviews
   - Slack messages
   - Task success/failure metrics
   - System performance data

2. Feedback Integration:
   - Update task suggestion weights
   - Refine phase transition rules
   - Improve dependency detection
   - Optimize task sequencing

## üîç Task Suggestion Algorithm
1. Input:
   - Current task status
   - SDLC phase
   - Historical task data
   - System context

2. Processing:
   - Query vector store for similar tasks
   - Apply phase-specific rules
   - Check dependencies
   - Calculate priorities

3. Output:
   - Next suggested task
   - Rationale for suggestion
   - Required prerequisites
   - Expected outcomes

## üìä Validation Rules
1. Task Alignment:
   - Must align with current SDLC phase requirements
   - Follow security & compliance guidelines from AI-SDLC-Deployment-Strategy.md
   - Meet performance requirements (‚â§1 ACU per request, max 4 ACU per session)
   - Support project objectives defined in SDLC.md
   - Require developer validation for phase transitions

2. Quality Checks:
   - Code standards compliance (PEP8, Airbnb TypeScript)
   - Security requirements (OAuth2, JWT, encryption)
   - Performance metrics tracking via Helicone
   - Documentation completeness and accuracy
   - Developer feedback collection through PR reviews and Slack

3. Continuous Validation:
   - Track suggestion accuracy against historical data
   - Monitor task completion rates and success metrics
   - Collect and analyze developer feedback
   - Validate ACU usage and optimization
   - Ensure compliance with AI-SDLC guidelines

4. Performance Monitoring:
   - Real-time tracking of suggestion accuracy
   - Task completion rate analysis
   - Developer acceptance metrics
   - System performance indicators
   - Resource utilization metrics

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement
- Track suggestion accuracy
- Monitor task completion rates
- Collect developer feedback
- Update suggestion algorithms
