📌 Setting Up Devin AI’s Knowledge Base

📌 Purpose:
Devin AI’s Knowledge Base allows it to store and recall essential information related to:
	•	Coding standards & best practices
	•	Project-specific workflows & architecture
	•	Security & compliance policies
	•	AI-driven development guidelines

By setting this up, we improve AI efficiency by reducing redundant queries and ensuring consistent execution of tasks.

📍 1. Defining Knowledge Base Categories

We will structure the Knowledge Base into logical categories, ensuring that Devin AI retrieves relevant information efficiently.

Category	Purpose	Example Topics
Coding Standards	Ensure AI follows best coding practices	Code style, naming conventions, formatting rules
AI Workflows & Automation	Define AI task execution rules	CI/CD, AI debugging, feature deployments
Project-Specific Guidelines	Store project architecture & design standards	API structures, database schema, component hierarchy
Security & Compliance	Enforce security protocols	Authentication, encryption, OWASP security principles
AI Testing & Validation	Establish AI testing criteria	Unit testing, integration testing, acceptance criteria

📍 2. Example Knowledge Base Entries

Now, let’s define real entries to be added to Devin AI’s Knowledge Section (Settings > Knowledge).

📝 Entry 1: Coding Standards

Trigger Description: "Coding Guidelines"
Content:

# 🔍 Coding Guidelines  
Devin AI must follow these standards when generating code:  
- **Python** → Use **PEP 8** standards. All functions must include **docstrings**.  
- **TypeScript** → Follow Airbnb’s TypeScript Style Guide. Use strict typing.  
- **Rust** → Follow Rustfmt styling rules. Ensure memory safety & error handling.  
- **Component Naming** → Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions.  
- **Security** → Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials. Use `.env` files.  
- **Testing** → All code must be tested before merging into `main` branch.  

✅ Why? → This ensures AI-generated code is maintainable and follows industry standards.

📝 Entry 2: AI Workflows & Automation

Trigger Description: "AI Workflow Execution Rules"
Content:

# ⚙️ AI Workflow Execution Rules  
- **Development Process:**  
  1️⃣ AI **writes the code** → 2️⃣ AI runs **unit tests** → 3️⃣ AI **documents the change** → 4️⃣ Human developer reviews & merges.  
- **Deployment Rules:**  
  - AI commits are reviewed before deploying via **GitHub Actions**.  
  - AI-generated releases are auto-tested before merging.  
- **PR Guidelines:**  
  - AI-generated PRs must include a **summary of changes** in human-readable format.  

✅ Why? → This ensures Devin AI follows structured execution rules instead of randomly modifying code.

📝 Entry 3: Project-Specific Guidelines

Trigger Description: "Project Architecture & API Rules"
Content:

# 📦 Project Architecture & API Guidelines  
- **Frontend Architecture** → Next.js (TypeScript) must follow modular component-based design.  
- **Backend APIs** → All API requests should be handled via **Hono (TypeScript)** and **FastAPI (Python)**.  
- **Database** → Use **Neon PostgreSQL**, structured using **Prisma ORM**.  
- **Authentication** → Implemented via **Clerk (OAuth2, JWT)** for security.  
- **AI Processing** → AI model calls should be routed via **AISuite** for cost-effective model selection.  

✅ Why? → This ensures AI correctly structures project modules & API endpoints.

📝 Entry 4: Security & Compliance

Trigger Description: "Security Best Practices"
Content:

# 🛡️ Security Best Practices  
- **Data Encryption:**  
  - Always encrypt sensitive data **at rest and in transit**.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  - Implement **OAuth2 & JWT** for secure user authentication.  
- **AI Security Rules:**  
  - AI **must never generate code that stores plaintext passwords**.  
  - AI must enforce **input sanitization** to prevent **SQL Injection & XSS attacks**.  
- **Logging & Auditing:**  
  - System logs must be stored securely and monitored via **Helicone & ELK Stack**.  

✅ Why? → This ensures Devin never creates security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code.

📝 Entry 5: AI Testing & Validation

Trigger Description: "AI Test Automation Rules"
Content:

# 🧪 AI Test Automation Rules  
- **Unit Testing**  
  - All AI-generated code **must include test cases** using Jest (TypeScript) or pytest (Python).  
- **Integration Testing**  
  - AI must execute integration tests before deploying backend services.  
- **Error Handling**  
  - AI should **log errors instead of silently failing**.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**  
  - AI-generated features must be validated against `TASKS.md` requirements before merging.  

✅ Why? → Ensures AI automates rigorous testing before deployment.
